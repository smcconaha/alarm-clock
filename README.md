# alarm-clock
A webpage that displays an alarm clock, in a digital display format.

## Requirements
Display the current time in a digital clock format
Display in this format: (Hours:Minutes:Seconds) (counting up to something within the same day) and (Day-Month-Year) if applicable (counting up to something on a different day)
Pick a time to make the alarm go off (this can be done as a variable)
Make sure the clock updates every second without refreshing the page
Start the alarm when the difference between the current time and the time the alarm is set for reaches 0 (Tip: use a javascript alert, you do not need it to make noise)
## Stretch Goals
Add the date (day, month, and year)
Add a button for toggling between a 12-hour and a 24-hour display
Have a button to snooze the alarm for 5 minutes
Have a toggle to turn on or off the alarm (I only wake up at 6 on the weekdays, but turn off my alarm on the weekend)
Allow the user to pick a time for the alarm to go off using an HTML datetime Input element
Change the font for the display; a mono-spaced font would look more like a digital clock
Play an audible alert when the alarm goes off
Make it look like an analog clock
